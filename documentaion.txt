Download and install a web server like Apache or XAMPP on your local machine.
Create a database in MySQL and import the database schema provided in the project.
Download the project files and extract them in the web server's root directory (htdocs for Apache and www for XAMPP).
Configure the database connection in the config.php file with your database credentials.
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where the project is hosted (usually http://localhost/project_name).
Use the "Add User" form to add new users to the system.
When a user is added, a verification email will be sent to their email address. The user will need to click on the verification link to verify their account.
The list of all users can be viewed on the "View Users" page, which displays the user's name, email, mobile number, and verification status (verified or unverified).
